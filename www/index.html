  <h2>What is Phoenix?</h2>

  <p>Phoenix is a game console that uses an old-style (16-bit) IBM PC as a base. It will have an
    operating system that is designed to run only a single program (game). A storage device such
    as a CD or zip disk will be used as a game 'cartridge'. The cartridge will hold the game and
    the OS in a single executable that will be launched during the computer's booting process.</p>

  <h2>Why Phoenix?</h2>
  <p>
    The name "Phoenix" comes from the <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_%28mythology%29">mythical bird</a> that burns and
    then rises anew from its ashes. Just as with its namesake, the Phoenix operating system rose
    from an earlier, unsuccessful attempt at building an operating system started by the Vermont
    Technical College Computer Club (VTC3). This older system was called "KOS" which was short for
    the "K Operating System" (no relation to the KDE desktop system). Nobody knows why the name
    KOS was chosen; most likely it was completely arbitrary, but it may be related to "chaos."
  </p>

  <p>Thus, Phoenix rose from the ashes of KOS.</p>

  <h2>Who is involved?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Peter Chapin</b> - Instructor.</li>
    <li><b>Nicholas Guertin</b> - Message passing in the kernel and testing.</li>
    <li><b>Curtis Aube</b> - Video module, game pad module and bootloader.</li>
    <li><b>Wei Yao Lin</b> - Thread handling, keyboard module and generic input module.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why are we doing it?</h2>
  <p>This project is for our Computer Engineering Degree senior project course:
    <b>CIS-4711/4712</b>. Our hope is that this project could be expanded upon in later years by
    other students in similar degrees. This project could be a great instrument for learning about
    the intricacies of how operating systems work.</p>
