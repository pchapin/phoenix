Phoenix
=======

Phoenix is a microkernel (message passing) operating system for 16 bit, real mode x86 processors
running in a PC architecture. It is intended to be used as a game console although other
applications are also possible. Phoenix was the BS.CPE senior project of Nick Guertin, Curtis
Aube, and Wei Yao Lin during the 2007/2008 academic year.

Phoenix development is done on Windows using the Open Watcom compiler and tools. There is one
dependency on NASM, and some of the scripts and tools are still Unix-specfic. Fixing these
issues is a work in progress.
