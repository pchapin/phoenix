Phoenix
=======

Phoenix is a microkernel (message passing) operating system for 16 bit, real mode x86 processors
running in a PC architecture. It was originally intended to be used as a game console, although
other applications are also possible. Phoenix was the BS.CPE senior project of Nick Guertin,
Curtis Aube, and Wei Yao Lin during the 2007/2008 academic year.

Phoenix development is done on Linux using the Open Watcom compiler and tools. Additional
packages that should be installed (on Ubuntu Linux) are:

+ nasm
+ graphviz
+ markdown
+ mtools
+ bochs

Nasm is used to assemble the boot loader. Graphviz and Markdown are used to build the
documentation. Mtools is used to manpulate floppy disk images. Bochs is an x86 emulator used to
test Phoenix applications.
